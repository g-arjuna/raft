What is required for route control with BGP when configuring granular route control?,"The configuration called ""Export Route Control Subnet"" must be used for each L3Out."
Why are separate L3Outs required for each BGP peer when there are multiple BGP peers and different route-control policies need to be applied?,"A separate L3Out is required for each BGP peer because ACI creates a route map per leaf, not per L3Out, which means that the same route-control policy cannot be applied to multiple BGP peers on the same leaf."
"How can multiple BGP L3Outs share the same access-encap VLAN/SVI in APIC Release 2.3(1) with an SVI Encap Scope ""VRF"" option?","Multiple L3Outs in the same VRF can share the same access-encap VLAN/SVI because an L3Out subnet scope option allows for route-control policy such as ""Export Route Control Subnet""."

What happens when SVI Auto State is enabled and all VLAN member ports on a border leaf are down?,The L3Out SVI can be brought down because of SVI Auto State.
Why is SVI Auto State useful in certain scenarios?,SVI Auto State helps prevent problems with static routes by allowing the L3Out SVI to be brought down when all VLAN member ports are down.
"What version of ACI introduced the feature ""SVI Auto State""?","The feature ""SVI Auto State"" was introduced in APIC Release 2.2(3) and 3.1(1)."
Why is it not available on ACI 3.0(x)?,It is not available on ACI 3.0(x) because it requires a higher version.
What is the location of the SVI Auto State option in ACI?,The SVI Auto State option is located under Tenant > Networking > External Routed Networks (or L3Outs) > L3Out > Logical Node Profiles > Logical Interface Profiles > SVI tab.
How do static routes in L3Out help ensure reachability of external networks despite vPC interface failures?,"Static routes are configured on each Logical Node Profile under ""Tenant > Networking > External Routed Networks (or L3Outs) > L3Out > Logical Node Profiles > Node > Static Routes"". This still requires associating the VRF and the External Routed Domain on the root L3Out component. The static route with a next-hop in the SVI 10 subnet remains in each routing table, allowing leaf 3 to see the route received via MP-BGP."
"What happens when vPC interfaces connected to an external router go down, but SVI Auto State is disabled on L3Out SVI 10?","When the vPC interfaces connected to the external router go down, and there are no member ports for VLAN 10, the L3Out SVI 10 remains up. However, static route with a next-hop in the SVI 10 subnet is removed from each routing table."
How does enabling SVI Auto State on L3Out SVI 10 help avoid reachability issues?,"When SVI Auto State is enabled and all the VLAN member interfaces go down, the L3Out SVI 10 also goes down. This results in leaf 1 and leaf 2 removing the static route with a next-hop in the SVI 10 subnet, preventing leaf 3 from seeing the unreachable route via MP-BGP."

What are the two options available for specifying a next-hop IP address in an ACI static route?,"The two options are None or Prefix. None refers to the NULL interface, which requires Next Hop IP to be 0.0.0.0/0, while Prefix allows for a specific next-hop IP address instead of NULL."
What is the purpose of using IP SLA Policy in an ACI static route?,The purpose is to track the next-hop availability by probing the next-hop IP itself instead of other IP addresses grouped and monitored by a Track Policy.
How does a Track Policy work in an ACI static route?,A Track Policy defines a group of IP addresses whose reachability is used by ACI to decide whether this next-hop entry for the static route should be kept in the routing table or not. The monitoring of these IP addresses is performed using the protocol defined in the IP SLA Policy nested in this track policy.
What is the difference between an IP SLA Policy and a Track Policy in an ACI static route?,"An IP SLA Policy directly sets the next-hop IP address, while a Track Policy uses a group of IP addresses to decide whether the next-hop entry should be kept in the routing table or not."

How does a track list work in IP SLA tracking for L3Out static routes?,"A track list defines which IP addresses to monitor, and the monitoring is performed using the protocol defined in the IP SLA Policy nested in this track policy. The track list brings down or up the static route itself or the next-hop depending on where the configuration is attached."
What is the threshold condition used in track lists?,"The threshold condition is based on the status of each track member, and when a certain percentage of track members are up, the track list is marked as up again."
How does a track list affect the routing table?,"A track list brings down or up the static route itself or the next-hop depending on where the configuration is attached. When a track list shows that there is enough reachability based on the threshold condition, it marks the track list as up again."
What is the significance of using percentages in track lists?,"Percentages are used to determine when the track list should be marked as down or up, allowing for flexibility and customization in tracking the reachability of IP addresses."

How does the Percentage parameter in a Track List work?,"The Percentage parameter represents the ratio of reachable track members over the total number of members, determining when the track list is marked as up or down."
What happens to Static routes or next-hops using a Track List when it reaches its Up Value (percentage or weight)?,"When the percentage or weight reaches its Up Value, static routes or next-hops using the track list are brought back up in the routing table accordingly."
Can you explain the concept of Up and Down Values for Track Lists?,"Yes, the Up Value determines when a Track List is marked as up if it was down prior to this value being reached, while the Down Value marks it as down if it was up prior to this value being reached."
What is the purpose of the IP SLA Policy in configuring Track Lists?,"The IP SLA Policy defines how to probe the destination IP address using specific protocols and L4 ports, ensuring reliable reachability checking."
How does the SLA Frequency (seconds) parameter affect Track List behavior?,"The frequency in seconds determines when the track member IP is probed, with a default value of 60 seconds."
Can you explain the different SLA Type options for L3Out static routes?,"The supported SLA Type options are ICMP or TCP with destination port, depending on the type of reachability being checked."
What is the difference between configuring an IP SLA policy and a Track List on a next-hop under an L3Out static route?,"Configuring an IP SLA policy or a Track List on a next-hop are functionally equivalent, but the IP SLA Policy is a shortcut where ACI internally creates a track list."

What is the purpose of setting a threshold in BGP to monitor prefix saturation?,"The purpose of setting a threshold in BGP is to monitor prefix saturation and raise a warning (eventRecord) when the number of received prefixes exceeds the configured percentage, allowing for proactive measures to be taken to prevent prefix exhaustion."
What happens when the maximum number of prefixes is exceeded in BGP?,"When the maximum number of prefixes is exceeded, the configured action is taken, which may include shutting down the BGP peer due to a maximum prefix violation."
How does the Remote AS feature work in eBGP peering support?,"The Remote AS feature allows specifying the AS number of the neighbor when eBGP peering is enabled, and if blank, it automatically uses the ACI BGP AS number. This field is optional for iBGP peering."
What is the purpose of using Local AS in L3Out node-level configurations?,"The purpose of using Local AS is to disguise the own BGP AS with a configured local AS when peering with another network, allowing the neighbor to peer with the local AS instead of the real ACI BGP AS."
What are the effects of the no-prepend option in L3Out node-level configurations?,The no-prepend option prevents ACI from prepending the local AS in the AS_PATH of routes learned from a neighboring network. This can be combined with replace-as to add only a local AS to the AS_PATH.
How does the dual-as option work in L3Out node-level configurations?,"The dual-as option allows the neighbor to peer with both a local AS and a real ACI BGP AS, while also applying the no-prepend and replace-as effects."
What is the purpose of setting up a BGP Protocol Profile?,The purpose of setting up a BGP Protocol Profile is to apply BGP Timer Policy and BGP Best Path Control Policy per node via the Logical Node Interface Profile.

What is the purpose of BGP Route Dampening Policy?,"BGP Route Dampening Policy is used to limit the number of routes that can be advertised by a router, preventing network instability and improving route accuracy. The policy has three main components: Reuse Limit, Suppress Limit, and Max Suppress Time, which control when routes are reused, suppressed, or unsuppressed."
How does BGP Route Dampening Policy work?,"When a route is advertised, it is assigned a penalty value based on the Half Life and Reuse Limit values. As time passes, the penalty value decreases until the route reaches the Reuse Limit, at which point it can be reused. If the penalty exceeds the Suppress Limit, the route is suppressed and not advertised."
What is the purpose of BGP Timer Policy?,BGP Timer Policy is used to configure keepalive intervals for BGP peering sessions. The policy controls when keepalive messages are sent to neighbors and how long a neighbor must respond before the session is considered down.
How does the Keepalive Interval work in BGP Timer Policy?,"The Keepalive Interval specifies how often keepalive messages should be sent to neighbors, while the Hold Interval specifies how long a neighbor can take to respond before the session is considered down. If the configured Keepalive Interval is larger than one-third of the negotiated Hold Interval, the smaller value is used."
What is the purpose of Stale Interval in BGP Timer Policy?,The Stale Interval is a timer that deletes stale routes from the routing table after a certain period of time has passed since the last route update. This ensures that older routes are not advertised indefinitely and prevents network instability.
How does Graceful Restart work in BGP?,"Graceful Restart allows one router to restart its routing process while keeping the other router stable, allowing for a smooth transition between sessions. The Graceful Restart Helper capability enables one router to assist another in restarting its routing protocol, preventing stale routes from being advertised indefinitely."
What is the purpose of the Restarts Timer in BGP?,The Restarts Timer is configured and advertised by a restarting router to inform its peer of the maximum time it will take for the router to finish restarting its routing protocol. This timer helps the Graceful Restart Helper device determine when to delete stale routes.
How does the Stale Interval work with Graceful Restart?,The Stale Interval is used by the Graceful Restart Helper device to delete stale routes from the routing table after a certain period of time has passed since the last route update. This ensures that older routes are not advertised indefinitely and prevents network instability.

Can OSPF routes be redistributed into EIGRP when advertising a BD subnet or performing Transit Routing?,"No, redistribution of routes into EIGRP is not necessary when using the automatically created route map on a border leaf."
What is the importance of awareness of OSPF implementation when there are multiple L3Outs on the same leaf in the same VRF?,"It ensures that subnet advertisement configuration changes do not affect other L3Outs, and proper routing decisions can be made."
What is the purpose of OSPF DR (designate router) / BDR (backup designated router) election?,"The OSPF DR/BDR election determines which router will participate in exchanging routing information with its neighbors, ensuring that only one router from each area is chosen to be the DR. This process helps maintain network stability and prevents unnecessary routing loops."
"What are the two main types of OSPF networks, and how do they differ?","The two main types of OSPF networks are broadcast and point-to-point. Broadcast networks allow broadcast traffic and typically use interface type SVI (short for Switched Virtual Interface). Point-to-point networks exist only between two routers and typically use interface type routed interface or subinterface. In contrast, point-to-point networks do not participate in the DR/BDR election."

What is the purpose of OSPF passive participation?,"The OSPF passive interface mode allows an interface to participate only in receiving routing information from its neighbors, without contributing any routing updates itself."
"How often should OSPF hello packets be sent, and what are the consequences if this interval is not matched across neighbors?","OSPF hello packets should be sent at regular intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds), and failing to match these intervals between neighbors can result in network instability and routing loops."
"What happens when an OSPF neighbor fails to respond within a certain time frame, known as the dead interval?","When an OSPF neighbor fails to respond within its designated dead interval, it is considered unreachable and may be removed from the routing table."
How does OSPF retransmit interval affect the stability of routing updates?,"The OSPF retransmit interval determines how often a router will send a routing update again if it receives an acknowledgement (LSAck) for the previous update. If no LSAck is received, the update is resent after the specified retransmit interval."

How do OSPF Area ID and OSPF Area Control interact?,"The OSPF Area ID defines the scope of all interfaces within a specific area, while the OSPF Area Control option determines whether redistributed LSAs are sent into an NSSA (not-so-stubby) area or not."
What is the purpose of disabling the Originate Summary LSA option in an OSPF NSSA area?,"Disabling this option prevents Type 4 and 5 LSAs from being sent into the NSSA or Stub area, and instead, the border leaf creates and sends a default route to the area."
What happens when the Suppress forwarding address in translated LSA option is enabled in an OSPF NSSA?,"When this option is enabled, the ACI border leaf does not add a forwarding address to the Type 5 LSA during translation, which can help avoid route installation issues."
What is the standalone NX-OS equivalent command for enabling the Suppress forwarding address in translated LSA option?,The command is `router ospf 1 vrf TK:VRF1 area 0.0.0.1 nssa translate type7 suppress-fa`.

How does OSPF use redistribution to advertise external routes to a VRF?,"OSPF uses redistribution to advertise external routes to a VRF by using Type-5 or Type-7 LSAs that contain redistributed external route information, which is then summarized and advertised within the VRF."
What is the purpose of OSPF summarization in the context of Cisco ACI L3Outs?,"OSPF summarization allows multiple L3Outs to share a summarized route, reducing the number of routes needed to be advertised outside the network. This is achieved by redistributing at least one subnet into the OSPF L3Out explicitly."

Can traffic between an IP in an L3Out directly connected subnet and other IPs be allowed without a contract?,"Yes, traffic between an IP in an L3Out directly connected subnet and other IPs may be allowed even without a contract, due to the default pcTag 1 assignment."
"What is the purpose of using more-specific subnets for L3Out EPGs instead of 0.0.0.0/0 with ""External Subnets for the External EPG"" scope?",Using more-specific subnets allows for more precise control over traffic routing and reduces the risk of unintended forwarding.
How does Cisco ACI handle contracts on non-border leaf switches that may have contract rules for multiple L3Outs?,"Cisco ACI handles contracts on non-border leaf switches by using a specific pcTag (pcTag 15) for 0.0.0.0/0, allowing traffic to be routed based on the VRF or L3Out BD."
What is the workaround configuration for preventing security concerns caused by default pcTag 1 assignment?,The workaround configuration involves disabling the default pcTag 1 assignment and applying a contract manually.
Why does Cisco ACI use pcTag 15 as a fixed value for 0.0.0.0/0 in source classification?,"Using pcTag 15 avoids allowing traffic where both the source and destination fall under the same 0.0.0.0/0 pcTag-prefix mapping, preventing communication within the same EPG."
What is the recommended configuration for L3Out interface subnets?,"The recommended configuration is to always configure the L3Out interface subnet with the ""External Subnets for the External EPG"" scope just in case."

What is the purpose of using Cisco ACI's specific pcTag assignments and contract configurations?,"The purpose is to provide precise control over traffic routing, reduce security concerns, and ensure compliance with network policies."
"What is the purpose of using an ""External Subnets for the External EPG"" scope when configuring a directly connected subnet?","This scope ensures that no unintended traffic passes through the ACI fabric, and it utilizes an enhancement from CSCuz12913 to force even a directly connected subnet to use the pcTag of the L3Out EPG instead of pcTag 1."
"Why is it recommended to explicitly configure a directly connected subnet with an ""External Subnets for the External EPG"" scope?",This ensures that no unintended traffic passes through the ACI fabric and addresses issues like unexpected drops due to pcTag 1 for directly connected subnets.
"What happens when there is an L3Out contract between two border leaf switches, and traffic is forwarded from one leaf to a directly connected IP on another leaf?","The ARP entry for the destination IP is used to resolve the next-hop MAC address, bypassing the contract due to pcTag 1 for directly connected subnets."
"What is the effect of setting Policy Control Enforcement Direction to ""Egress"" on traffic to or from an L3Out?","It affects only traffic to or from the L3Out by deploying contract rules on both border-leaf and non-border-leaf switches, potentially saving TCAM resources."
What is the purpose of Policy Control Enforcement Direction in Cisco ACI?,"It saves TCAM resources for contracts on border leaf switches, primarily affecting traffic to or from an L3Out."
When was Policy Control Enforcement Direction introduced in APIC Release 1.2(1)?,"This option was introduced in APIC Release 1.2(1), providing a feature to save TCAM resources for contracts on border leaf switches."

What is the main reason for using Policy Control Enforcement Direction with an L3Out contract?,"To save TCAM resources for contracts on border leaf switches, primarily affecting traffic to or from an L3Out."
"How does setting Policy Control Enforcement Direction to ""Egress"" impact EPGs that need to talk to the L3Out?","The TCAM resources for contracts on border leaf switches could be a bottleneck because a border leaf deploys all contracts, while non-border leaf switches typically distribute them to multiple leaf switches."
"What is the primary benefit of setting Policy Control Enforcement Direction to ""Ingress"" instead of ""Egress""?","It means that contract rules are deployed only on non-border leaf switches, potentially saving TCAM resources."
When was Policy Control Enforcement Direction introduced in APIC Release 1.2(1) and what was its default configuration?,"This option was introduced in APIC Release 1.2(1), with the default configuration being ""Ingress""."

How does setting Policy Control Enforcement Direction affect the deployment of contract rules on non-border-leaf switches?,"When set to ""Egress"", contract rules are deployed on both border-leaf and non-border-leaf switches; when set to ""Ingress"", they are deployed only on non-border leaf switches."
What is the relationship between Policy Control Enforcement Direction and TCAM resources in Cisco ACI?,"It affects only traffic to or from an L3Out, primarily saving TCAM resources for contracts on border leaf switches."
"How does the ""Ingress"" option affect contract application on non-border leaf switches?","When the ""Ingress"" option is set in this feature, a contract for packets from or to L3Out is always applied on a non-border leaf switch. This means that the non-border leaf acts as an ingress point and applies the contract to incoming traffic."
"What is the purpose of the ""Egress"" option when configuring filters in Cisco ACI?","The ""Egress"" option is used to indicate whether a contract should be applied on the egress leaf or the ingress leaf, depending on the remote endpoint's learning on the ingress leaf."
How does Transit Routing allow the ACI fabric to become a transit network?,Transit Routing allows the ACI fabric to become a transit network by advertising external routes that were learned from one external routing domain to another. This enables devices in different subnets to communicate through ACI L3Outs.
"What is the purpose of the ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope under the L3Out EPG subnet?","The ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope is used to advertise routes from one L3Out to another, enabling devices in different subnets to communicate through ACI L3Outs."
"How does the ""Import Route Control Subnet"" scope affect Transit Routing?","The ""Import Route Control Subnet"" scope provides controls for external routes that ACI may learn. However, it is not used as often as the default import behavior, which suffices in most situations."
What are some common mistakes to avoid when configuring Transit Routing?,"Common mistakes include configuring routes with an ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope on both L3Outs, rather than specifying which one should advertise the route. Similarly, configuring routes on the wrong L3Out can lead to incorrect routing decisions."
What is the role of border leaf switches in Transit Routing?,"Border leaf switches play a crucial role in Transit Routing by learning and redistributing external routes into the L3Out routing protocol. They also advertise routes using the ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope."
How does Cisco ACI handle routing and contract configurations for L3Outs?,"Cisco ACI uses both routing and contracts to achieve network connectivity between subnets through L3Outs. The ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope is used for routing, while contracts are used for traffic filtering."
"What is the purpose of the ""Apply Both Directions"" option when configuring filters in Cisco ACI?","The ""Apply Both Directions"" option ensures that filters are applied to both incoming and outgoing traffic, regardless of the direction of the traffic."
"How does the ""Ingress-Only"" option affect contract application on non-border leaf switches?","When the ""Ingress-Only"" option is set in this feature, a contract for packets from or to L3Out is only applied on the ingress leaf. This means that the non-border leaf acts as an egress point and does not apply the contract to outgoing traffic."
What is the benefit of using Reverse Filter ports in Cisco ACI?,"Using Reverse Filter ports provides a way to manage filters more efficiently, especially when dealing with complex network configurations or multiple directions of traffic."
How does Transit Routing enable devices in different subnets to communicate through L3Outs?,Transit Routing enables devices in different subnets to communicate through L3Outs by advertising external routes that were learned from one external routing domain to another. This allows devices to communicate across subnet boundaries.
"What is the purpose of the ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope in contract configurations?","The ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope is used to specify which route should be exported and advertised from a particular L3Out. This ensures that the correct routes are advertised to the outside world."
How does Cisco ACI handle traffic filtering in Transit Routing scenarios?,"Cisco ACI uses contracts to filter traffic between subnets through L3Outs. The ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope is used to specify which route should be filtered, while the ""Apply Both Directions"" option ensures that filters are applied to both incoming and outgoing traffic."
What is the purpose of using VRF tags when performing Transit Routing in Cisco ACI?,"The primary purpose of using VRF tags in Transit Routing is to prevent potential routing loops by identifying routes as belonging to specific Virtual Networks (VNFs) or subnets, which can help avoid loopback scenarios."
"How does the ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope affect subnet configuration in Cisco ACI?","The ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope should be used with caution, as it implies that the subnet belongs to a routing domain behind the L3Out, and using it on the same subnet with another scope can create a routing loop."
What is the limitation of contracts for 0.0.0.0/0 in Transit Routing?,"The limitation of contracts for 0.0.0.0/0 in Transit Routing was introduced in APIC Release 2.3(1) and restricts certain configurations, requiring users to refer to guidelines or specific documentation for more information."
What is the purpose of VRF tags in conjunction with OSPF or EIGRP route tagging?,"VRF tags are used to prevent potential routing loops when performing Transit Routing using OSPF or EIGRP by identifying routes as belonging to specific subnets, which helps avoid loopback scenarios."
How does Cisco ACI set the VRF tag on subnets that advertise out via L3Outs?,"Cisco ACI sets the VRF tag on subnets that advertise out via L3Outs using redistribution (or OSPF area filter) to get external routes from other L3Outs, and it includes this tag in both BD subnets and Transit Routes."
What is the behavior of Cisco ACI when an external route with its own VRF tag is encountered?,"Cisco ACI will not use the route in its routing table if it encounters a route with its own VRF tag, to prevent potential loops."
"How does the ""Import Route Control Subnet"" scope for OSPF and EIGRP relate to the table-map feature?","The ""Import Route Control Subnet"" scope shares the same route map as the table-map feature from NX-OS, which is used for VRF tags in Transit Routing."
What is the default value of the VRF tag for all VRFs in Cisco ACI?,"The default value of the VRF tag for all VRFs in Cisco ACI is 0, and it can be changed using a Route Tag policy located under ""Tenant > Policies > Protocol > Route Tag""."
What is the purpose of changing the VRF tag from the default value when Transit Routing is expected to learn routes from another VRF?,"Changing the VRF tag from the default value ensures that routes learned from other VRFs are recognized and included in the routing table, avoiding potential loopback scenarios."
How does Cisco ACI use VRF tags to prevent loops in Transit Routing?,Cisco ACI uses VRF tags to identify routes as belonging to specific subnets and prevents potential loops by not including these routes in its routing table if they have a different VRF tag.
What is the location of the Route Tag policy in Cisco ACI?,"The Route Tag policy can be found under ""Tenant > Policies > Protocol > Route Tag""."
Can Transit Routing be configured without using VRF tags?,"No, Transit Routing requires the use of VRF tags to prevent potential loops and ensure correct routing."
How does the table-map feature from NX-OS relate to VRF tags in Cisco ACI?,"The table-map feature shares the same route map as VRF tags in Cisco ACI, which is used to identify routes as belonging to specific subnets."
Why does ACI use a specific range of route tags internally for various reasons?,ACI uses these internal route tags to prevent conflicts of usage in the network. The recommended ranges are 4294966001 - 4294966512 and 4294967287 - 4294967295.
"What is the focus of Figure 92, which illustrates all the combinations of L3Outs related to Transit Routing?",The focus is advertising routes via BGP L3Out A. It does not mean that all of the other L3Outs have to be deployed at the same time.
How does ACI implement BGP L3Outs differently compared to other L3Outs such as OSPF and EIGRP?,"ACI uses BGP in user VRFs for infra MP-BGP as well as for user L3Outs, which results in the BGP IPv4/IPv6 database having all external routes from other L3Outs on the same border leaf."
What is the purpose of an outbound route-map applied to BGP peer neighbor sessions on a border leaf?,The outbound route-map is used for Transit Routing control with BGP L3Out.
"Why does ACI create one outbound route-map per BGP L3Out, which is applied to all BGP peers on the same L3Out?","By default, ACI creates one outbound route-map per BGP L3Out, which is then shared with BD subnet advertisement."
What happens if both Transit Routing for BGP and BD subnet advertisement are not configured with correct subnets?,This can lead to unintended advertisement of subnets.
How does OSPF L3Out implementation for Transit Routing rely on redistribution?,ACI redistributes external routes from BGP to OSPF using an “Export Route Control Subnet” scope so that OSPF can advertise them to the outside for Transit Routing.
Why doesn't ACI use redistribution if another OSPF L3Out is on the same border leaf?,"Redistribution is not an option because it would be the same routing protocol, and instead, ACI uses an area-filter with an “in” direction."
What is the purpose of the shared route map for OSPF and EIGRP L3Outs in the same VRF on the same border leaf?,The shared route map ensures that both Transit Routing and BD subnet advertisement are configured with correct subnets.
What is the enhancement request filed by ACI regarding the shared route-map between OSPF and EIGRP?,"There is an enhancement request filed to address this shared route-map between OSPF and EIGRP, CSCuy63998."
Why does ACI internally create two route maps (one for routing protocols and one for static or direct routes) in OSPF and EIGRP?,An “Export Route Control Subnet” scope deploys the same IP prefix-list entry on both route maps.
What is the primary purpose of using Route Profiles in Cisco ACI?,"Route Profiles are used to add user-defined matching or set rules for internal route maps, allowing users to configure specific routing policies for various use cases such as L3Outs, infra MP-BGP, and BD subnet advertisement."
How do Route Profiles interact with the tenant-level configuration in Cisco ACI?,"Route Profiles are configured at both the tenant level (under ""Tenant > Networking > External Routed Networks..."") and the L3Out level (under ""{L3Out} > Route Maps/Profiles""). Both levels use Match and/or Set Rules from the same tenant-level location."
What is the difference between the components in a Route Profile compared to those in a normal route map on a router?,"The components in a Route Profile are merged into route maps that implement other APIC policies, such as Transit Routing. This means that the order and action of context policies are not the same as in a normal route map."
"What is the purpose of the ""Order"" option in Cisco ACI's Route Profiles?","The Order option determines the sequence number for the context policies to be applied. However, since this is merged into implicit route maps, the actual sequence number will not be the same as this order number."
"How does the ""Action"" option in Cisco ACI's Route Profiles relate to the previous option?","The Action option is equivalent to permit or deny in a normal route map. This was introduced in APIC Release 2.3(1) and replaced the earlier label ""Set Rules""."
What are some examples of use cases for using Route Profiles in Cisco ACI?,"Examples include redistributing BD subnets to the outside via L3Outs, exporting external routes from one L3Out to another (Transit Routing), limiting learning of external routes, and interleaving external routes from L3Outs to BGP for infra MP-BGP."

How does the type of Routing Policy (e.g. Match Prefix AND Routing Policy) affect the behavior of a Route Profile?,"The type of Routing Policy used in a Route Profile determines its behavior and how it is applied to subnets. For example, a Match Prefix AND Routing Policy will apply to all configured L3Out subnets with matching direction scope."
What is the role of an Explicit Prefix List in a Route Profile?,"An Explicit Prefix List is not used in a Route Profile that uses Type “Match Prefix AND Routing Policy ” without it. In such cases, the prefix criteria are matched implicitly based on the IP prefix-list subnet."
How does an L3Out association affect the behavior of a Route Profile when it comes to BD subnet announcements?,"An L3Out association determines whether a Route Profile is used for BD subnet announcements. If the BD subnet is different from the IP prefix-list subnet, the advertisement is configured via the L3Out association."
What happens when an “Export Route Control Subnet ” scope is used to advertise BD subnets instead of the L3Out association?,"In such cases, the rules from the Route Profile (e.g. Set Rule A) will apply to the BD subnet advertisement as well."
Can a Route Profile control both IP prefix-list subnets and BD subnets?,"Yes, a Route Profile can be used to control both IP prefix-list subnets and BD subnets. The behavior depends on the type of Routing Policy used and how it is associated with the L3Out EPG."

"What is the benefit of using the ""default-export"" or ""default-import"" Route Profiles when applying a custom Route Profile to an L3Out EPG?","These pre-configured profiles simplify the process of creating a custom Route Profile, as they provide a standard set of settings that can be easily adapted for specific use cases."
"How does the ""Export/Import Route Control Subnet"" scope affect L3Out subnet configurations in Cisco ACI?","The ""Export / Import Route Control Subnet"" scope only affects configurations within this scope, allowing administrators to manage L3Out subnets independently of other route profiles and settings."
"What is the recommended approach for applying Set Rules or additional Match Rules when using the ""Match Prefix AND Routing Policy"" Route Profile type?","Administrators should use L3Out subnets exclusively without an Explicit Prefix List (except for matching prefix criteria), as merging prefixes can make configurations harder to consume and maintain."
Can administrators apply custom Route Profiles to L3Out EPGs regardless of the Route Profile type?,"No, as the specific requirements of each Route Profile type (e.g., ""Match Prefix AND Routing Policy"" or ""Match Routing Policy Only"") dictate how L3Out subnets should be configured."
How does ACI handle conflicting route profiles when multiple Route Profiles are applied to an L3Out EPG?,"ACI will prioritize the most specific rule set from each Route Profile, as more specific rules take precedence over less specific ones in resolving routing conflicts."
"What is the benefit of using the ""External Subnets for the External EPG"" scope in Cisco ACI?","This scope allows administrators to use L3Out subnets independently of other route profiles and settings, providing greater flexibility when managing complex routing scenarios."
"Can administrators simplify their Route Profile configurations by using pre-configured profiles (e.g., ""default-export"" or ""default-import"")?","Yes, as these pre-configured profiles provide a standard set of settings that can be easily adapted for specific use cases, reducing the complexity of Route Profile configuration and management."

What is the purpose of advertising internal routes to external devices?,Advertising internal routes to external devices allows external devices to have reachability to servers connected to ACI by promoting BD subnets from the tenant's network to the outside world via L3Outs.
How do you advertise internal routes (BD subnets) in ACI?,"Internal routes can be advertised using a contract between an EPG and the associated L3Out. The BD subnet is installed on border leaf switches, followed by redistribution through a route-map rule to promote the BD subnet via the iBGP protocol."
What is the purpose of Export Route Control Subnet scope in L3Out?,"Export Route Control Subnet scope allows external routes to be advertised from one L3Out to another L3Out for Transit Routing, enabling communication between two L3Outs instead of a normal EPG."
How does Export Route Control Subnet scope work?,"Export Route Control Subnet scope creates a route-map rule on border leaf switches to redistribute the configured subnet (10.0.0.0/8) from other L3Outs into the routing protocol for this L3Out, using an IP prefix-list."
What is the requirement for Export Route Control Subnet scope?,"The subnet with ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope needs to be exactly the same as what is in the routing protocol database. This prevents unnecessary advertising of subnets and ensures accurate route redistribution."
"Can you explain why an external route with ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope should not be configured on a learning L3Out?","If an external route with ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope is configured on a learning L3Out, it would mean the L3Out tries to advertise the route back to its learning source. This could potentially cause a loop in routing."
What is the purpose of External Subnets for External EPG scope?,"External Subnets for External EPG scope should be configured on the L3Out that is learning the route, allowing it to advertise external subnets without causing a potential loop in routing."
How do you configure External Subnets for External EPG scope?,"This scope should be configured on the L3Out that is learning the route. If configured elsewhere, it could lead to unnecessary advertising of routes and potential loops in routing."
What happens if two L3Outs use the same routing protocol on the same border leaf?,"In this case, other methods than redistribution are used for route promotion between the two L3Outs, as direct redistribution is not applicable."
Can you explain what IP prefix-list is used for in Export Route Control Subnet scope?,"The IP prefix-list is used to ensure that only specific subnets (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8) are exported and redistributed from one L3Out to another, preventing unnecessary advertising of other routes."
What should be considered when configuring Export Route Control Subnet scope?,"Aggregation/summarization options for the subnet with ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope can be explored in more detail, but it's recommended to consult specific sections or documents for detailed information."
Can you explain why using a contract between an EPG and L3Out is necessary for internal route advertisement?,Using a contract enables the proper installation of BD subnets on border leaf switches and ensures that redistribution through a route-map rule promotes these subnets via the iBGP protocol.
How does Cisco ACI classify external routes to apply a contract?,"External routes are classified based on prefix matching using the ""External Subnets for the External EPG"" scope on an L3Out subnet."
"What is the difference between the ""External Subnets for the External EPG"" scope and the ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope in Cisco ACI?","The ""External Subnets for the External EPG"" scope does not impact the routing table, whereas the ""Export Route Control Subnet"" scope affects the routing table by using IP prefix-lists."
How does Cisco ACI classify traffic in an L3Out EPG based on the source or destination IP address?,"Traffic is classified based on the longest prefix match (LPM) using the ""External Subnets for the External EPG"" scope, which allows for more specific subnets to be configured."
"What happens when a traffic IP does not match any of the subnets in the ""External Subnets for the External EPG"" scope?","The traffic will likely be dropped as there is no L3Out EPG with a contract in the VRF for the IP, unless a 0.0.0.0/0 subnet is configured."
"Can the same subnet be configured with ""External Subnets for the External EPG"" scope in multiple L3Out EPGs?","No, this configuration will be rejected, except for 0.0.0.0/0 subnets, which are an exception but should not be configured in multiple L3Out EPGs."
What is the purpose of configuring a contract between an L3Out EPG and components that need to communicate with the L3Out?,The contract is used to specify the rules for traffic exchange between the L3Out EPG and other networks or systems.
How does Cisco ACI distribute external routes learned from L3Out to all leaf switches in the infra MP-BGP configuration?,Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP) in the ACI fabric infrastructure distributes the external routes learned from L3Out to all leaf switches.
What is deployed on all leaf switches and route reflector spine switches in the infra MP-BGP configuration?,"The BGP IPv4/v6 Address Family is deployed on all leaf switches, and the BGP VPNv4/v6 Address Family is deployed on all route reflector spine switches."
How do leaf switches establish iBGP sessions in the infra MP-BGP configuration?,Leaf switches establish iBGP sessions as part of the infrastructure MP-BGP configuration.

How does Cisco ACI ensure that external routes are properly distributed and managed in the infra MP-BGP configuration?,"The infrastructure MP-BGP configuration ensures that external routes learned from L3Out are properly distributed to all leaf switches, using Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP)."
What is the purpose of using Reverse Filter ports when configuring filters in Cisco ACI?,"Reverse Filter ports should be used always when Apply Both Directions is enabled, and they deploy exactly as defined for both consumer-to-provider and provider-to-consumer directions with source and destination ports reversed. This ensures that routes are correctly filtered and propagated between the user VRF and the infra VRF."
What happens to BGP IPv4/v6 AF on a border leaf when an L3Out is deployed?,"The BGP IPv4/v6 AF on the same border leaf automatically creates a redistribution rule for all the routes from the routing protocol of the L3Out within the same user VRF, known as ""Interleak""."
What is Interleak in the context of L3Out?,Interleak refers to the process by which redistributed IPv4/v6 routes are exported from the user VRF to the infra VRF and imported back into the user VRF through route-reflector spines.
How do VPNv4/v6 routes distributed through route-reflector spines get imported from the infra VRF to the user VRF?,"VPNv4/v6 routes are imported into the user VRF as IPv4/v6 on each leaf switch, using BGP IPv4/v6 AF with export and import rules that utilize a common route target (RT) for all leaf switches in the same VRF."
What is the purpose of the route target (RT) in Cisco ACI?,"The RT is used to exchange routes between VPNv4/v6 AF and BGP IPv4/v6 AF, ensuring that only routes from the same VRF are imported into the user VRF."
Can OSPF be configured as the IGP for BGP in an L3Out?,"Yes, Cisco ACI allows BGP and OSPF to be configured together in an L3Out as an exception, enabling OSPF to serve as the IGP for BGP."
What is the root component of L3Out?,"The root component of L3Out consists of three main components: VRF, external routed domain, and routing protocol."

What is Route Control Enforcement in L3Out?,"Route Control Enforcement enables Import Route Control, allowing users to configure Import Route Control Subnet scope for a subnet under the L3Out EPG (L3Out Networks)."
What is the purpose of configuring a route map for Interleak?,The route map used for Interleak is customized to redistribute external routes into the infra MP-BGP.
What is GOLF in Cisco ACI?,"GOLF stands for Giant OverLay Forwarding, which requires provider labels to be configured on a GOLF L3Out in the infra tenant and matching consumer labels to be configured on L3Outs in user tenants/VRFs."
What is the primary function of L3Out Node and Interface Profiles in Cisco ACI?,The primary function of L3Out Node and Interface Profiles is to specify which switch nodes should be border leaf switches and which interfaces should speak a routing protocol.
How can multiple ways of achieving the same configuration exist for node IDs in Node Profiles and Interface Profiles?,"With Node and Interface Profiles, you can achieve the same configurations in multiple ways as long as the node IDs in the Node Profiles and Interface Profiles match."
What are the three different patterns illustrated for configuring node-101 e1/1 and node-102 e1/1 to be part of L3Out1?,"The three patterns are: (1) both interfaces in the same Logical Interface Profile A under a Logical Node Profile A, (2) each interface in its own Logical Interface Profile A and B under the same Logical Node Profile A, and (3) each interface in its own Logical Interface Profile A and B under their respective Logical Node Profiles A and B."
What is the purpose of using Router ID as Loopback Address in a Logical Node Profile?,"To create a loopback interface on this node with the router ID as its IP address, typically required when BGP peers need to source from a loopback with the router ID as their IP address."

What is the purpose of creating a loopback interface manually with arbitrary IP addresses in a Logical Node Profile?,"To create a loopback interface on this node manually with an arbitrary IP address, typically required unless BGP peers need to source from a loopback IP address."
How do static routes work in L3Out Node Profiles?,"A static route configured here is distributed to other leaf switches via infra MP-BGP, and if not configured, a static route with a null next-hop is created on the node."
What happens when there are two L3Outs with the same routing protocol on the same node in the same VRF?,"The router ID on the Node Profiles of both L3Outs needs to match, as using different router IDs in multiple L3Outs with the same routing protocol on the same node is equivalent to trying and entering two conflicting configurations."
What are the main configuration options under the Logical Interface Profile?,The subsection covers the main configuration options available in the Logical Interface Profile.
How do Logical Interface Profiles for IPv4 and IPv6 differ when configured on the same interface?,"When IPv4 and IPv6 addresses need to be configured on the same interface, separate Logical Interface Profiles are required for each protocol."
What is the purpose of infra MP-BGP in distributing static routes from L3Out Node Profiles?,To distribute static routes from a node to other leaf switches via infrastructure MP-BGP.
How do different router IDs on the same node impact L3Out configurations?,Using different router IDs on the same node with the same routing protocol results in conflicts and should be avoided by matching the router ID on both Node Profiles.
What is the purpose of creating static routes in L3Out Node Profiles?,To create a static route on this node that can be used for routing between nodes within an infrastructure.
How do loopback addresses affect BGP peerings and traffic routing?,"Loopback addresses are used to source from when BGP peers need to reach remote networks, and the IP address is used as part of the routing decision process."
What is the key consideration when configuring L3Outs on a node with multiple VRFs and same routing protocol?,Ensuring that the router ID on both Node Profiles matches for each L3Out instance to avoid conflicts.
What is the main purpose of creating an Interface Profile in Cisco ACI?,"The main purpose of creating an Interface Profile in Cisco ACI is to configure interfaces for routing protocols on border leaf switches, allowing them to join the routing protocol and participate in network operations."
"What are the three types of Path options available in an L3Out, and which interface type can be used with each?","The three types of Path options available in an L3Out are Port, Sub-Interface, and Direct Port Channel. Each supports different interface types: Routed Interface for Port and Sub-Interface, and Routed Interface for Direct Port Channel."
"What is the purpose of configuring a Protocol Interface Profile, and what happens if one is not configured?","Configuring a Protocol Interface Profile allows an interface to join the routing protocol and participate in network operations. Without a Protocol Interface Profile, the interface will not join the routing protocol."
What are some optional features that can be configured under the General tab of a Logical Interface Profile?,"Optional features that can be configured under the General tab of a Logical Interface Profile include Data Plane Policing, NetFlow, PIM Interface Policy, Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), and Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)."
What is the purpose of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) in Cisco ACI?,"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is used to detect whether a path between two nodes is forwarding or not, allowing for faster failure detection and network recovery."
How does the VLAN parameter differ between Routed Sub-Interface and SVI configurations?,"The VLAN parameter can be configured for Routed Sub-Interfaces and SVIs, but not for Routed Interfaces."
What happens if a physical port is already used as a trunk port by an EPG?,"If a physical port is already used as a trunk port by an EPG, it cannot be used as a Routed Sub-Interface or a Routed Interface (L3 port) in an L3Out."

What is the difference between a routed or subinterface and an SVI configuration in terms of VLAN Pool requirements?,"Routed or subinterfaces do not require a VLAN Pool under the L3 Domain, while SVIs do require a VLAN Pool under the External Routed Domain (L3Domain) associated with the L3Out."
Can multiple trunk interfaces be configured for an SVI on different Logical Interface Profiles?,"Yes, when the same interface needs to trunk two different VLANs for two different SVIs, each SVI must be configured in a separate Logical Interface Profile."
What is the purpose of the MAC Address field in a Logical Interface Profile?,"The MAC Address field provides an optional MAC address for the subinterface, routed interface, or SVI, which can be left as default for most cases."
How do different SVI configurations support multiple trunk interfaces and VLANs?,"Different types of SVI configurations, such as one SVI with multiple trunk interfaces, are supported in Cisco ACI."
"How does Cisco ACI handle MTU settings for subinterfaces, routed interfaces, and SVIs?","The default MTU value of 9000 bytes can be inherited from the ACI default or adjusted depending on the routing protocol. However, it's essential to ensure that the MTUs between router interfaces match for correct peering."

What is the requirement for using route control with multiple BGP peers?,"A separate L3Out is required for each BGP peer, especially when all BGP peers are connected to the same border leaf."
Why is it difficult to have two different VLANs for each BGP peer?,"It's challenging because BGP peers can be multi-hop L3 adjacencies, and having separate VLANs for each BGP peer may not be feasible in such situations."
What feature was introduced in APIC Release 2.3(1) to enable multiple L3Outs in the same VRF to share the same access-encap VLAN/SVI?,"The SVI Encap Scope ""VRF"" option, which allows L3Out BDs spanning across different VLANs."
Who is responsible for creating route maps per VRF and per leaf for OSPF and EIGRP instead of per L3Out?,"ACI creates a route map per VRF and per leaf for OSPF and EIGRP, unlike BGP where route maps are created per L3Out."
"What is the requirement for SVI parameters (IP and MTU) when using the SVI Encap Scope ""VRF"" option?","The same SVI parameters must be applied on both L3Outs, as there cannot be any conflicts on the border leaf."
When was the SVI Auto State feature introduced in ACI?,"The SVI Auto State feature was introduced in APIC Release 2.2(3) and 3.1(1), but not available on 3.0(x)."
What is the purpose of enabling SVI Auto State?,"To allow a border leaf to bring an L3Out SVI down when all its VLAN member ports are down, typically avoiding problems with static routes."
How does ACI handle static routes when SVI Auto State is disabled?,"When SVI Auto State is disabled, the L3Out SVI remains up regardless of the VLAN member ports' status, potentially causing issues with static routes."

What is the difference between ACI's approach to route control with OSPF and EIGRP compared to BGP?,"While both protocols use route maps, ACI creates a route map per VRF and per leaf for OSPF and EIGRP, whereas BGP uses route maps per L3Out."
What is the purpose of Preference when configuring a static route in Cisco ACI?,"The Preference setting determines the administrative distance for the next-hop IP, which is used to program the hardware. If it is zero or unspecified, ACI uses the Base Preference to take effect."
What are the two possible types of Next Hop Type settings when configuring a static route in Cisco ACI?,"The two possible types of Next Hop Type settings are None and Prefix. None refers to the NULL interface, while Prefix allows for specifying the actual next-hop IP instead of NULL (0.0.0.0/0)."
What is the purpose of IP SLA Policy when configuring a static route in Cisco ACI?,"The IP SLA Policy option sets an IP SLA policy directly on the next-hop IP, allowing for tracking the next-hop availability by probing the next-hop IP itself instead of other IP addresses."
Can a Next Hop Addresses entry have both IP SLA Policy and Track Policy?,"No, a Next Hop Addresses entry can have either an IP SLA Policy or a Track Policy, not both. The two policies cannot be used simultaneously."
What is the purpose of Track Policy when configuring a static route in Cisco ACI?,The Track Policy configuration defines a group of IP addresses whose reachability is used by ACI to decide whether this next-hop entry for the static route should be kept in the routing table or not.
How does IP SLA tracking for L3Out static routes work in Cisco ACI?,"IP SLA tracking involves probing a group of IP addresses, which defines the track list that monitors the reachability condition. Based on the threshold condition configured in the track list, the static route and/or the next-hop is kept in the routing table."
What type of traffic can be used for probing in an IP SLA track list?,"Probing traffic can include ICMP, TCP destination port 22, or other relevant endpoint IPs that may be applicable to the static route."
How does a track list determine its status in relation to the threshold condition?,"If one of the track members becomes unreachable, the percentage goes down to 50%, and the track list is marked as down. When the ratio of track members that are up reaches 51%, the track list is marked as up again."
What is required for a track list to take effect in Cisco ACI?,The Track Policy field must be used in the static route or its next-hop configurations to associate the track list with either the static route or its next-hop.
Can IP SLA tracking for L3Out static routes be attached to only one component (static route or next-hop)?,"No, an IP SLA track list needs to be attached to either a static route or its next-hop configurations to take effect."
What is the significance of the percentage threshold condition in an IP SLA track list?,The percentage threshold condition determines when the track list is marked as down (50% of track members up) or when it is marked as up again (51% of track members up).
How often does probing traffic occur in an IP SLA track list?,"Probing traffic occurs every 60 seconds, which allows for real-time monitoring of the track list's status."
What type of protocol is used by the probing traffic in an IP SLA track list?,"The probing traffic can use ICMP or TCP destination port 22 as the protocol, depending on the configuration of the track member."
How does the percentage threshold condition work in relation to multiple track members?,"If one track member becomes unreachable, the percentage goes down to 50%, and the track list is marked as down. When both track members become reachable again, the percentage goes up to 100%, and the track list is marked as up again."
What is the purpose of the Track Policy field in Cisco ACI?,"The Track Policy field is used to associate an IP SLA track list with either a static route or its next-hop configurations, allowing for real-time monitoring of the track list's status."
What are the two types of track list thresholds that can be used to configure filters in Cisco ACI?,"The two types of track list thresholds are Percentage and Weight. Percentage is the ratio of reachable track members over the total number of members, while Weight is the sum of weights for reachable track members."
What is the purpose of an Up Value (percentage or weight) when configuring a track list in Cisco ACI?,The Up Value determines when a track list is marked as up if it was previously down. This value should be set to a specific percentage or weight that indicates when the track list has reached a certain level of reliability.
What happens to static routes or next-hops using the track list when the Down Value (percentage or weight) is reached?,"When the Down Value is reached, the track list is marked as down, and static routes or next-hops using the track list are brought down in the routing table accordingly."
"What is a Track Member, and what information does it require to configure an IP SLA policy in Cisco ACI?","A Track Member is the configuration that defines an IP address to which ACI sends a probe. This includes the destination IP, scope of the track member (L3Out or BD), and IP SLA Policy."
What is the purpose of the Destination IP when configuring a Track Member in Cisco ACI?,"The Destination IP is the target IP address to probe, which can be the next-hop IP of a static route, an external IP, or an endpoint IP."
What are the supported methods for BGP peering IP reachability for both iBGP and eBGP in Cisco ACI?,"The supported methods are Direct connection, Static route, and OSPF."
What is the purpose of a BGP Peer Connectivity Profile in Cisco ACI when configuring L3Out?,"A BGP Peer Connectivity Profile contains options such as neighbor IP address, remote AS (for eBGP), and EBGP multihop (for eBGP)."
How do you configure BGP on the root of an L3Out in Cisco ACI?,"To configure BGP on the root of an L3Out, you need to enable BGP and associate VRF and External Routed Domain with the L3Out root."
What is the difference between configuring an IP SLA policy or a track list on a next-hop under an L3Out static route?,"Configuring an IP SLA policy or a track list on a next-hop under an L3Out static route are functionally equivalent, but the former uses the BGP Peer Connectivity Profile for configuration."
What is the minimum iBGP configuration required in Cisco ACI?,The minimum iBGP configuration requires only the neighbor IP address to be configured within the BGP Peer Connectivity Profile.
How do you configure eBGP peering under the BGP Peer Connectivity Profile in Cisco ACI?,"To configure eBGP peering, you need to add Remote AS and EBGP multihop to the BGP Peer Connectivity Profile."

What is the format of route-map names in Cisco ACI L3Outs?,"Route-map names follow the format ""imp-L3Out-<L3Out name>-peer-<VRF VNID>"" or ""exp-L3Out-<L3Out name>-peer-<VRF VNID>""."
What feature was introduced from APIC Release 1.2(2) to dynamically establish BGP peering with multiple neighbors?,The Dynamic Neighbor (Prefix Peers) feature allows L3Outs to dynamically establish BGP peering with any IPs in the subnet.
Does the Dynamic Neighbor feature start a BGP session by itself?,"No, BGP with dynamic neighbor configuration does not start a BGP session by itself; another side needs to explicitly configure the ACI border leaf IP to start a BGP session."
What is the standalone NX-OS equivalent command for configuring dynamic neighbors in Cisco ACI L3Outs?,The router bgp 65001 vrf TK:VRF1 neighbor 10.0.0.0/30 command can be used.
In what scenario does BGP with dynamic neighbor configuration not start a BGP session?,BGP with dynamic neighbor configuration does not start a BGP session in scenarios where the other side has not explicitly configured the ACI border leaf IP to start a BGP session.
What is the purpose of the Prefix Peers feature in Cisco ACI L3Outs?,The Prefix Peers feature allows L3Outs to dynamically establish BGP peering with any IPs in the subnet.
